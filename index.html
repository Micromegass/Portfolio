                        <p> Hi, I'm Axel. I am a Fullstack Developer and an Economist. I love code and I am also a

                            a B.A. in Economics. Always being fascinated with code, combined with my thirst for
                            knowledge I
                            came to Colombia (Medellín), where I completed the Make it Real Bootcamp to turn myself
                            into a
                            Fullstack Developer. I love to create things and to have to opportunity to always learn
                            and
                            improve my skillset. To gain a more profound knowledge of algorithms and programming
                            concepts I
                            decided to enroll again into a Computer Science major at the University of Hagen.
                            Motivation, persistence and the willingness to give a 100% in all the things I do is
                            what
                            defines me.

                    <p class=""> I started to learn to code roughly about a year ago. My first programming language
                        was Ruby and
                        I still really enjoy coding in Ruby. The Bootcamp I completed at <span class="link"><a class="link"
                                href="https://www.makeitreal.camp/">
                                Make it Real</a></span>
                        taught me more than I
                        could have ever imagined about this language and its frameworks like Rails and Sinatra.
                        There
                        are always more things to
                        know about a programming
                        language, but I feel very comfortable and secure with Ruby. I
                        deployed various RoR Web Applications on Heroku and some pure Ruby projects on <span class="link"><a
                                href="https://github.com/Micromegass">Github</a></span>. I write
                        clean HTML and CSS and I often integrate Bootstrap into my projects. My second coding
                        language
                        I learned was Pascal. As I am studying Computer Sciences next to my fulltime job, I studied
                        the
                        fundamentals of algorithms, pointers and lists and that really helped me to understand
                        programming more profoundly. Javascript and jQuery were next, and even though all the
                        brackets
                        were confusing to me in the beginning, I started to really enjoy the sheer power of
                        Javascript
                        and jQuery in Web
                        Applications and almost every project of mine includes Javascript and jQuery. But I still
                        have
                        a lot to learn and I am trying to improve every day. Since I am part of a study group here
                        at
                        my work in EAFIT which wants to explore and learn about machine learning, I also started to
                        learn Python. For my Web Projects I am starting to integrate
                        React and last but not least I am starting to study JAVA this semester. This hopefully
                        illuminates me even more in Object Oriented Programming. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/Micromegass"><span>Github</span></a>

                    </h3>
                    <p> Realizing that I love to create things, solve problems and always learn something new, I
                        decided to enroll again in the distance university of Hagen to major in Computer Sciences.
                        The
                        university is the only state
                        universtiy in Germany that allows you to study in different countries and take your exams
                        in
                        the German schools around the world. It also allows you to study at your own rhythm while
                        working fulltime. It is a normal Bachelor of Science programme in which you learn all there
                        is
                        to know about the fundamentals of Computer Sciences</p>

                    <p> I took part in an intensive instructor-led coding Bootcamp at Make it Real. The programme
                        included three phases. The first phase
                        included self-study and an
                        entrance test. Once accepted, the second phase started which consisted of intensive 12-week
                        full-time programme. Everyday students and the teacher came together to study Ruby, Rails,
                        Sinatra,
                        Javascript, jQuery, APIs, Testing, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and various other such as
                        responsive
                        design, testing techniques
                        and deploying different services such as Heroku and Amazon Web services. During
                        post-phase students were assigned a mentor and asked to complete the rest of the online
                        platform
                        which is full of material, coding challenges and projects.

                    <p> Because I was interested in the workings of the economy I studied Economics and Anglistic
                        at
                        the university of Friedrich-Alexander. Apart from Economics my degree involved a broad

                        of subjects. I studied critical theory and I also enrolled in

                                        <p> This project was created for a band called Brickwater. They are from
                                            Nürnberg, a city in the south of Germany. They are pretty well known
                                            locally and want to start to become more professional, that's why I
                                            designed and created the webpage for them. Their music is great, you
                                            should
                                            head to the website and check them out. </p>
                                        <br>

                                        <p> For me, creating this webpage was as much fun as it was challenging.
                                            Especially because their singer came up with new ideas what to
                                            implement on
                                            the page every day. That's why I had to restructure a lot and do a lot
                                            of
                                            research until the final product was presented. In turn, I learned a
                                            lot
                                            and I am very happy to have worked with the band and I am proud of my
                                            result </p>

                                        <p> This project was my first project using pure Javascript and jQuery for
                                            the
                                            backend. The website generates a random 4-digit number which the user
                                            has
                                            to guess. Each time the user enters a 4-digit number the website tells
                                            the
                                            users how many picas (correct numbers, but wrong place) and how many
                                            fijas
                                            (correct number at the right place) the input number has. The user
                                            keeps on
                                            guessing until the right number is found. Once guessed correctly the
                                            user
                                            can pick up a new game.</p>
